This repository contains reports based on the data analysis of publicly avalaible data mostly provided by Government agencies in New Zealand. Below is a short description of each analysis project and a link to the .PDF file which contains the detailed data analysis.

**1. [Crime in Selwyn District - A Sanpshot of 10 years worth of data](Selwyn_Crime_Data_Analysis_Final.pdf):** This report presents the results of analysis of crime data sourced from the [NZ Police Data](https://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publications-statistics/data-and-statistics/policedatanz). The data has been filtered to focus on Selwyn District.

**2. [Crime and Deprivation in Auckland & Northern Districts of New Zealand](Crime and Deprivation in Auckland and Far North.pdf):** This paper presented the results of a study on the role of project managers in ASD projects. This study was a Mixed Methods study as well and used a combination to surveys and interviews for data collection. This study was unique as it presented different aspects of the project managerâ€™s role such as the informal activities, the management approaches adopted on a day-to-day basis and their influence on Agile practices used by the team. The version uploaded here is a pre-print one and the final published version can be accessed [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.110871).
