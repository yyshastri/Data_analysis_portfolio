# Data Analysis Samples
This repository contains reports based on the data analysis of publicly avalaible data mostly provided by Government agencies in New Zealand. Below is a short description of each analysis project and a link to the .PDF file which contains the detailed data analysis.

**1. [Crime in Selwyn District - A Sanpshot of 10 years worth of data](Selwyn_Crime_Data_Analysis_Final.pdf):** This report presents the results of analysis of crime data sourced from the [NZ Police Data](https://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publications-statistics/data-and-statistics/policedatanz). The data has been filtered to focus on Selwyn District.

**2. [Crime and Deprivation in Auckland & Northern Districts of New Zealand](Crime_and_Deprivation_in_Auckland_and_Northern_districts.pdf):** This report presents the analysis of two different datasets which were combined to give a more holistic view. The first dataset was based on NZ Police data and dealt with victimizations and crime in Auckland and the Northern districts. The second dataset focused on the money spent on gambling in communities across North Island and the extent of deprivation in those areas.
